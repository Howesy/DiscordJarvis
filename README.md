# Discord Jarvis

Discord Jarvis was developed on the latest version of Discord.JS at the time: (V12)

Discord Jarvis is a easy deployable framework for a discord bot, taking advantage of modularly structured commands and events for organisation and cleanliness. Taking inspiration from the fictional artifical super-intelligence "Jarvis", this structure allows you to perform advanced functions while remaining simplistic for users to command.

All code contained within is fully commented so you can understand the inner workings of everything that is occuring.
Obviously I can't explain everything in-depth otherwise the files would be a million lines long each.
So you'll have to do some research to figure out specific stuff yourself, but there is documentation and knowledge everywhere.

This frameowrk also comes included with various utility functions and an embed constructor for easy on the fly embeds, making your bot the flashiest in the business.

# Dependencies

Installing this project is simple, all you need to do is download this project as ZIP and extract the file and folders to any directory you'd like.
