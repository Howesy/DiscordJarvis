# Discord Jarvis

Discord Jarvis is a easy deployable framework for a discord bot, taking advantage of modularly structured commands and events for organisation and cleanliness. Taking inspiration from the fictional artifical super-intelligence "Jarvis", this structure allows you to perform advanced functions while remaining simplistic for users to command.

# Dependencies

This repository is dependant on these node modules:

[x] - Discord.js (v12)

## Installation

Installing this project is simple, all you need to do is download this project as ZIP and extract the file and folders to any directory you'd like.

Once you've extracted all the files to your chosen directory, follow this list of directives:

• Install the "discord.js" node module to the directory you've extracted DiscordJarvis to.
• Retrieve your Discord bot's token and place it inside the "privateSettings.js" file.

If you want an example of how to perform these actions, direct your attention to the (Installation Tutorial) section.
